# 📊 AQI Index Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📝 Project Description

AQI Index Analysis is a Power BI data analytics project that visualizes and analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across Indian states and cities.
The dashboard provides insights into air pollution levels, prime pollutants, city-wise AQI comparison, AQI trends over time, and pollutant frequency distribution to help understand environmental conditions and pollution severity.

This project is designed for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making, using interactive Power BI visuals and DAX measures.


## 🎯 Key Objectives

Analyze AQI levels by city and state

Identify minimum, maximum, and average AQI

Detect AQI categories (Good to Hazardous)

Determine prime pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, etc.)

Visualize AQI trends over time

Compare pollution severity across cities
